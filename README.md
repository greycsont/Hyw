why there's a script called PauseMenu and I can't find the pause menu that used it?

why there's no perfab of pause menu?

why the UI's perfab's onClick does not have method on it?

when did the canvas that contains pause menu instantiated? (it's in the scene thanks Bryan)

I think the OptionsMenu is the class I'm looking for right?

wtf is OptionsMenuToManager?

why the OptionsMenuToManager.pausedMenu will change?

why I open up the cheats menu the CheatsController.Update will call OptionsMenu.Pause that sets pauseMenu to active as well?

unity's rendering logic is GOAT. who f knows that the last GameObject in the hierarchy is f the one rendered on top?
